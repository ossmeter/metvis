# MetVis
MetVis is a JSON-based specification language for describing how data should be visualised. It's original purpose was for visualising OSSMETER metrics, but it can be used to visualise any data.

MetVis currently supports the following visualisation types:

* Line chart
* Bar chart
* Table

To aid in the development of MetVis specifications, there is a playpen web page (doc/index.html), and a built-in test data generation framework (src/generator).
